<p id = "p1">Botanical gardens are real arenas for the conservation of plant biodiversity.
  These amazing institutions take on not only the role of an ecological archive,
  but also actively participate in programs for the conservation of rare and endangered species.
  One of the important tasks of botanical gardens is to create conditions for the reproduction and
  conservation of vulnerable plants. This includes creating and maintaining optimal conditions for
  their growth, reproduction and adaptation to new environmental conditions. Gardens often collaborate
  with other institutions and scientific laboratories to conduct research on plant breeding.
  Conservation programs often include the active collection and conservation of seeds of rare species.
  This allows you to create "safety copies" in the event of a threat of extinction in the natural environment.
  Botanists and staff of the garden conduct systematic research, studying the biology and genetics of plants
  in order to effectively conduct breeding programs and maintain the health of populations.
  An important aspect of plant conservation is their active introduction into society.
  Botanical gardens often hold educational events, telling visitors about the importance of
  biodiversity conservation and the role of everyone in this process. This helps to raise public
  awareness and support for environmental and nature conservation issues.
  Thus, botanical gardens not only provide colorful and amazing landscapes,
  but also actively contribute to the preservation of the flora, ensuring its long-term survival
  and strengthening awareness of the importance of caring for nature.</p>
